# 🎬 Cinema with Friends

Welcome to **Cinema with Friends** — a small Python terminal game where you and a friend can step into a virtual cinema, argue about movies, and finally pick one to watch (or rage quit 😅).

## 🚀 Features

* 👥 **Play with a buddy** — both players enter their names (no Elon Musk bots allowed).
* 🎟️ **Check available movies** — browse through a mini movie list.
* ❌ **Quit anytime** — if you’re not feeling it, you can always storm out of the cinema.
* 🎥 **Pick your movie** — choose by number and lock in your decision.
* 🛑 **Validation included** — no fake names, no alphabet movie picks, and no nonsense.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Run the Python file:

   ```bash
   python Cinema.py
   ```
2. Enter **two names** (for you and your friend).
3. Decide whether to check the movie list.
4. Pick a movie by number or quit like a drama king.

## 🎞️ Movie List (default)

* Inception
* The Dark Knight
* Interstellar
* Titanic
* Avatar

## 🤓 Notes

* Written in pure **Python** (no extra libraries needed).
* Perfect for practicing **loops, conditionals, and input handling**.
* Warning: May contain mild sarcasm in the code responses 😉.
