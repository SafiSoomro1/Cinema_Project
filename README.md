# 🍿 Cinema With Friends

Yo! This is just a fun little Python game I made as my first ever project 🎉.
The idea is simple: you and a buddy go to a fake cinema, check out the movies, and pick one to watch… or just rage quit.

What it does

Asks for both your names (no numbers allowed, you’re not Elon Musk’s kid 🤖).

Shows you a list of movies (if you wanna see them).

Lets you pick a movie by number.

Or you can quit like a boss.

# Movies you can pick from

Inception

The Dark Knight

Interstellar

Titanic

Avatar

# How to play

Run it with Python:

python Cinema.py


Type your names.

Decide if you wanna check the movies.

Pick one or get outta there.

👉 It’s nothing crazy, just me learning loops, inputs, and some error handling. But hey, it works!
