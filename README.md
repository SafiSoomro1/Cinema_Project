# 🍿 Cinema With Friends

Yo! This is just a **fun little Python game** I made as my **first ever project** 🎉.
The idea is simple: you and a buddy go to a fake cinema, check out the movies, and pick one to watch… or just rage quit.

## What it does

* Asks for both your names (no numbers allowed, you’re not Elon Musk’s kid 🤖).
* Shows you a list of movies (if you wanna see them).
* Lets you pick a movie by number.
* Or you can quit like a boss.

## Movies you can pick from

* Inception
* The Dark Knight
* Interstellar
* Titanic
* Avatar

## How to play

1. Run it with Python:

   ```bash
   python Cinema.py
   ```
2. Type your names.
3. Decide if you wanna check the movies.
4. Pick one or get outta there.
